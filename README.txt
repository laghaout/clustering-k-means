- If in 1D, 2D, 3D, plot
- All checks on files and inputs
- List of all input controls
- Get images, vectors, or matrices (with trace), or text (without stemming or n-grams)
- Check all combinations of C and N
- GUI interface (HTML or Windows)
- Executable
- Report of similarity between final centroids and the cardinality of the clusters
- Convergence criterion
- Object orientation
